						I was born in 1998 in the city of Baden, Switzerland. I grew up in a
						small town called Wildegg in the canton of Aargau. I spent a large
						part of my early childhood on my uncle's farm &#40;as my parents
						were both working&#41;, where I learned to appreciate the beauty of
						nature and the importance of hard work. During my kindergarden and
						primary school years you would find me with my friends and brothers
						in the neighborhood or the nearby forest.
						<br></br>
						<br></br>
						Always having been a technically inclined boy, I was naturally
						fascinated when my father introduced me to the world of computers.
						It didnt take long until I got my hands on a computer of my own and
						started to adventuring into the beautiful, seemingly infinite depths
						of the internet. Whether it was playing games, learning about new
						concepts or just listening to music, computers became an influental
						part of my teenage years.

						In primary school I was a member of the local soccer team and played
						for a few years, after which I dipped my toes into table-tennis and
						kung-fu. I also took piano lessons for all my school years and
						participated in the annual theater play of the local church a few
						times &#40;I even got to play the lead role a few times&#41;.
						<br></br>
						<br></br>
						Today I still spend a lot of time on the internet, but thankfully I
						have a very active group of friends and a good connection to my
						family. I especially enjoy playing board, card and video games with
						my friends. Like most I also watch movies and series and even read
						the occasional book. There always has to be music playing somewhere
						for me to feel comfortable &#40;seriously, my Spotify statistics are
						a bit scary&#41;.
